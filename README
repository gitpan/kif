Purpose of the Kernel Installation Facility (kif):

Automate the building and installation of a linux kernel from source on all
processor architectures.

The installation process is broken into a number of distinct phases which can
be executed from beginning to end or anywhere in the middle.  Phases can be
suppressed if necessary.

Currently kif has been implemented on the following architectures:

	Architecture	Bootloader

	alpha		aboot
	ppc (Mac)	Bootx
	x86		GRUB, LILO

kif is a perl script and a number of additional perl modules that fully
automate the building and installation of Linux kernels and makes it easy to
manage multiple kernels and/or kernel configurations.

Getting kif:

The source code and distributions are kept on sourceforge.net as:

    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/kif/

The source code is available via anonymous cvs, the installation kit can be
downloaded via http or ftp from any of the sourceforge mirrors.

You can also get it from my PAUSE account:

    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/M/MU/MUNROER/kif/

And I usually keep the latest development version available at:

    http://www.csworks.com/download/kif.html

Installing kif:

kif is provided with a standard perl module installation script.  After
unpacking the installation kit, do the following:

cd /kif/directory/
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

and that's it.  There aren't any tests.

Reporting Bugs:

Please use the bug reporting and tracking interface provided by sourceforge.

Extending kif:

If you modify or extend kif, please contact me [Dick Munroe,
(munroe@csworks.com)] with the changes so that I can include them in the
next release.  Documentation of all changes is required as is adherance to the
Revision History format used in each source file.  (I use tools to keep track
of and build the Changes file, so if you don't follow the rules it makes more
work for me).

If you want to be part of the kif development "team" let me know why and what 
you want to do and I'll consider it.

Looking for work:

On another subject entirely, I'm looking for work (contract or permanent).  I
do a lot more than just hack Perl.  Take a look at my:

can work out.
